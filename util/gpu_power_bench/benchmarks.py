"""The ten GPU power benchmarks: {FP8, FP16} × {MUL, ADD, Softmax, GeLU, LayerNorm}.

Each benchmark is a small factory that returns a callable `f()` plus metadata
describing the workload. The driver calls `f()` K times in a tight loop
between NVML power samples; total_ops = K × ops_per_call, and Joules/op is
(E_total − P_static × t_total) / total_ops.

FP8 notes:
  * `torch.float8_e4m3fn` lands in torch 2.1+. A100 (sm_80) has no native FP8
    tensor-core path, so elementwise ops are computed by promoting through
    fp16/fp32; H100 (sm_90) runs FP8 on HW. Either way, the *energy* to
    complete the workload is what we actually want to measure — the benchmark
    just reports what the silicon does.
  * For Softmax / GeLU / LayerNorm, reductions and non-linearities run in
    fp32 math even when the input is fp16/fp8 (standard numerical practice).
    We quote FLOP counts only as first-order estimates; `joule_per_element`
    is the precision-agnostic primary metric.

# ============================================================================
# Matmul variants — "Tensor Core vs CUDA Core" + "native FP8 via Transformer
# Engine" comparison axis. These add up to 5 variants that sweep over the
# matrix side length K (M = N = K for a square-square GEMM).
# ============================================================================
#
# What each variant runs:
#   matmul_fp32_simt : fp32 inputs, TF32 explicitly DISABLED → CUDA cores (SIMT)
#                      MAD.  This is the Tensor-Core-off baseline.  Same FLOPs
#                      as TC paths, vastly more joules — that delta is the
#                      "Tensor Core energy advantage".
#   matmul_tf32_tc   : fp32 inputs, TF32 enabled → TF32 Tensor Core path.
#                      Ampere+ (sm_80+) only.  10-bit mantissa, 8-bit exponent.
#   matmul_fp16_tc   : fp16 inputs → FP16 Tensor Core (wmma).  Both A100 & H100.
#   matmul_bf16_tc   : bf16 inputs → BF16 Tensor Core.  Same peak as FP16 but
#                      different numerics (more dynamic range).  Both A100/H100.
#   matmul_fp8_te    : FP8 (E4M3) via Transformer Engine fp8_autocast on
#                      te.Linear.  On H100 this hits native FP8 Tensor Cores;
#                      TE on pre-Hopper falls back to FP16 TC — benchmark is
#                      auto-skipped or tagged as "fallback" accordingly.
#
# Why these are the right variants:
#   * fp32_simt is the only way to force "no Tensor Core" for a GEMM; PyTorch
#     dispatches fp16/bf16 matmul to Tensor Core unconditionally on Ampere+.
#   * tf32 vs fp16 TC on the same GPU measures the energy cost of
#     mantissa width while keeping the same HW unit.
#   * fp8 TE is the unique H100 capability we want to price vs A100 FP16 TC.
#
# Load axis: matrix side length K (M = N = K).  FLOPs per call = 2·K³.
# Memory:    3 × K² elements (A, B, out).  K=12288 fp32 ≈ 1.7 GB — fits on
# both 80 GB A100 (HBM2E) and 80 GB H100 with large margin.
